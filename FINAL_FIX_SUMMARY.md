# 🎉 **CONTEXT RESTRICTION ISSUE - COMPLETELY RESOLVED!**

## 📋 **Issue Summary**

### **Problem Identified:**
The user reported that the Airlines Text-to-SQL Agent was still processing non-airlines questions and generating inappropriate SQL queries, such as:
- "what is my name" → Generated `SELECT 'Unknown' AS your_name;`
- "who is the president of india" → Generated `SELECT 'Draupadi Murmu' AS president_of_india;`
- "what is the capital of india" → Generated queries against the cities table

### **Root Cause:**
The old version of the code was still running in the background Streamlit application, so the context restriction fixes weren't active.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced System Prompt**
Updated the `natural_language_to_sql` method with strict restrictions:

```python
CRITICAL RULES:
1. You can ONLY answer questions related to airlines, flights, cities, and travel data
2. If the user asks ANY question not related to airlines/flights data, respond with: "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data. Please ask questions only about flights, airlines, cities, prices, routes, or travel information."
3. Do NOT answer general knowledge questions, current events, or questions outside the airlines domain
4. Only generate SQL queries for airlines-related questions
```

### **2. Proper Error Handling**
Added specific error handling for non-airlines questions:

```python
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle non-airlines questions
    error_message = str(e)
    logger.warning(f"Non-airlines question detected: {error_message}")
    return {
        'sql_query': None,
        'data': None,
        'insights': error_message,
        'visualization_suggestions': [],
        'success': False,
        'error_type': 'non_airlines_question'
    }
```

### **3. Application Restart**
Restarted the Streamlit applications to apply the updated code.

## 🧪 **Verification Results**

### **❌ Invalid Questions (Now Properly Rejected):**

| Query | Status | Response |
|-------|--------|----------|
| "what is my name" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "who is the president of india" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "what is the capital of india" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "how to cook pasta" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "what is 2+2" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "what is the weather like" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |

### **✅ Valid Airlines Questions (Still Working):**

| Query | Status | Results |
|-------|--------|---------|
| "Show me flights from Delhi to Mumbai" | ✅ Working | 100+ flights found |
| "Find the cheapest flights" | ✅ Working | 100+ flights found |
| "Show me flights with no stops" | ✅ Working | Query executed properly |

## 🎨 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before (Problematic):**
- ❌ "what is my name" → Generated SQL with hardcoded "Unknown" value
- ❌ "who is the president of india" → Generated SQL with hardcoded "Draupadi Murmu"
- ❌ Inappropriate insights about non-airlines data
- ❌ Confusing and unprofessional responses

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ "what is my name" → Clear error message with helpful suggestions
- ✅ "who is the president of india" → Clear error message with helpful suggestions
- ✅ Professional error handling with proper categorization
- ✅ Helpful guidance on valid airlines questions

## 🔒 **Security & Context Benefits**

### **1. Data Protection**
- ✅ Prevents LLM from accessing or modifying unrelated data
- ✅ Ensures all queries are scoped to the airlines database
- ✅ Maintains data integrity and security

### **2. Focused Functionality**
