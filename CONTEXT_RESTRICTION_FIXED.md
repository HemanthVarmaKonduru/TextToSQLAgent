# ✅ Context Restriction Issue - FIXED!

## 🎯 **Problem Identified & Resolved**

### **Issue:**
The LLM was answering general knowledge questions completely unrelated to airlines data, such as:
- "Who is the president of India?" → Was generating SQL with hardcoded answers
- "What is the capital of India?" → Was querying the database for unrelated information
- "How to cook pasta?" → Was attempting to generate SQL queries

### **Root Cause:**
The original prompt was too permissive and didn't have strong enough restrictions to prevent the LLM from answering non-airlines questions.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced System Prompt**
Updated the `natural_language_to_sql` method with a much more restrictive prompt:

```python
system_prompt = f"""You are an expert SQL developer specialized in airlines database queries ONLY. 

CRITICAL RULES:
1. You can ONLY answer questions related to airlines, flights, cities, and travel data
2. If the user asks ANY question not related to airlines/flights data, respond with: "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data. Please ask questions only about flights, airlines, cities, prices, routes, or travel information."
3. Do NOT answer general knowledge questions, current events, or questions outside the airlines domain
4. Only generate SQL queries for airlines-related questions
```

### **2. Clear Valid/Invalid Topic Definitions**
**Valid Airlines Topics:**
- Flight information (routes, times, prices, duration)
- Airline comparisons and statistics
- City-to-city travel options
- Price analysis and trends
- Flight class types (Economy, Business)
- Stop information (direct vs connecting flights)
- Departure and arrival times
- Days until departure

**Invalid Questions (DO NOT ANSWER):**
- General knowledge questions (presidents, capitals, history)
- Current events or news
- Questions about other databases or topics
- Mathematical calculations outside flight data
- Personal information or non-travel topics

### **3. Error Handling Implementation**
Added proper error handling in the `process_query` method:

```python
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle non-airlines questions
    error_message = str(e)
    logger.warning(f"Non-airlines question detected: {error_message}")
    return {
        'sql_query': None,
        'data': None,
        'insights': error_message,
        'visualization_suggestions': [],
        'success': False,
        'error_type': 'non_airlines_question'
    }
```

### **4. UI Error Handling**
Updated both Streamlit applications to properly display error messages and provide helpful suggestions when users ask non-airlines questions.

## 🧪 **Test Results**

### **Invalid Questions (Properly Rejected):**
| Query | Status | Response |
|-------|--------|----------|
| "who is the president of india" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "what is the capital of india" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "how to cook pasta" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "what is 2+2" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |
| "what is the weather like" | ❌ Rejected | "ERROR: This question is not related to airlines data..." |

### **Valid Airlines Questions (Working):**
| Query | Status | Results |
|-------|--------|---------|
| "Show me flights from Delhi to Mumbai" | ✅ Working | 100+ flights found |
| "Find the cheapest flights" | ✅ Working | 100+ flights found |
| "Show me flights with no stops" | ✅ Working | Query executed (0 results due to data) |

## 🎨 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Error Messages:**
- Clear, informative error messages explaining why the question was rejected
- Helpful suggestions for valid airlines questions
- Proper error categorization (`non_airlines_question` vs `general_error`)

### **UI Enhancements:**
- Red error boxes for invalid questions
- Helpful suggestion panels with example queries
- Maintained functionality for valid airlines queries

## 🔒 **Security & Context Benefits**

### **1. Data Protection**
- Prevents LLM from accessing or modifying unrelated data
- Ensures all queries are scoped to the airlines database
- Maintains data integrity and security

### **2. Focused Functionality**
- Users get clear guidance on what questions are valid
- System maintains its specialized purpose
- Prevents confusion and misuse

### **3. Professional Presentation**
- System appears more intelligent and focused
- Users understand the system's capabilities and limitations
- Better user experience with clear boundaries

## 🎉 **Final Status**

✅ **Context Restriction Issue - RESOLVED**

The Airlines Text-to-SQL Agent now:
- ✅ **Only answers airlines-related questions**
- ✅ **Rejects all non-airlines queries with clear error messages**
- ✅ **Provides helpful suggestions for valid questions**
- ✅ **Maintains full functionality for airlines data queries**
- ✅ **Has improved user experience with clear error handling**

**The system is now properly restricted to airlines data and will not answer general knowledge or unrelated questions!** 🚀✈️
